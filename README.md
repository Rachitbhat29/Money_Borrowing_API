API Details

### Login API endpoint for Authentication with Username and Password

Here is how you use login API to authenticate with user login and password credentials using cURL:

```
$ curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/login" -H  "accept: */*" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\":\"rachit\",\"password\":\"rachit123\"}"
```

Well, the above request uses json object to pass username and
password. And password is applied with sha256 alogrithm for encrypting and checked with the stored values in Db. 


### Add Transaction API endpoint for adding transaction.

```
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8" POST --data "{\"transaction_from\":1,\"transaction_type\":\"B\",\"transaction_amount\":200,\"transaction_status\":\"Unpaid\",\"transaction_with\":2,\"reason\":\"loan\"}" http://localhost:5000/add_transaction
```

This included a transaction in the Db. User need to send payload with below values
```
{ user_id, transaction_id (random hash), transaction_type (borrow/lend), transaction_amount (negative, positive), transaction_date, transaction_status (paid/unpaid), transaction_with (user_id) }
